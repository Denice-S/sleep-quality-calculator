          <p>
            <b>Are you getting enough sleep? Are you getting quality sleep? </b>
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of us need around 8 hours of good-quality sleep a night to feel
            and perform at our best. Some will need more and some less and this
            can depend on factors such as age, health and lifestyle.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are lots of factors that can cause poor sleep, some of these
            include: stress and anxiety, drinking too much alcohol/caffeine, a
            poor sleeping environment, disturbance from children or partners,
            bad sleeping habits or it could also be due to medical factors.

            The effects of a lack of sleep are well known and many of us will
            have experienced these at one time or another during our lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of these effects include feeling irritable and moody,
            difficulty concentrating and staying alert and not being able to
            work properly. Aside from these, prolonged sleep deprivation can
            have consequences for your physical health as well.

            If any of this resonates with you, its time to look at your sleep
            habits.

            <h2>Benefits of good sleep quality</h2>
            <p>
              Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout
              our lives. Even the way you feel while you're awake depends in
              part on what happens while you're sleeping. Getting enough quality
              sleep at the right times can help protect your mental health,
              physical health, quality of life, and safety.

                <summary>Sharper Brain</summary>
                Without enough sleep, it's tough to focus and take in new
                information. Your brain also doesn't have enough time to
                properly store memories so you can pull them up later.Sleep lets
                your brain catch up so you're ready for what's next.

              <details>
                <summary>Mood Boost</summary>
                Another thing that your brain does while you sleep is process
                your emotions. Your mind needs this time in order to recognize
                and react the right way. Refreshing slumber helps you hit the
                reset button on a bad day, improve your outlook on life, and be
                better prepared to meet challenges.

                <summary>Healthier Heart</summary>
                While you sleep, your blood pressure goes down, giving your
                heart and blood vessels a bit of a rest. The less sleep you get,
                the longer your blood pressure stays up during a 24-hour cycle.
                High blood pressure can lead to heart disease, including stroke.
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary>Steadier Blood Sugar</summary>
                During the deep, slow-wave part of your sleep cycle, the amount
                of glucose in your blood drops. Not enough time in this deepest
                stage means you don't get that break to allow a reset -- like
                leaving the volume turned up.
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary>Germ Fighting</summary>
                Ongoing lack of sleep changes the way your immune cells work.
                They may not attack as quickly, and you could get sick more
                often. Good nightly rest can help you avoid that tired, worn-out
                feeling, as well as spending days in bed as your body tries to
                recover.

                <summary>Weight Control</summary>
                When you're well-rested, you're less hungry. Being
                sleep-deprived messes with the hormones in your brain -- leptin
                and ghrelin -- that control appetite.
