          <h2> Benefits of good sleep quality </h2>
          <p> 
            Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout our lives. 
            Even the way you feel while you're awake depends in part on what happens while you're sleeping.
            Getting enough quality sleep at the right times can help protect your mental health, physical health, quality of life, and safety.

             <summary>Sharper Brain</summary>
             Without enough sleep, it's tough to focus and take in new information. Your brain also doesn't have enough time to properly store memories so you can pull them up later.Sleep lets your brain catch up so you're ready for what's next.

           <details>
            <summary>Mood Booster</summary>
            Another thing that your brain does while you sleep is process your emotions. Your mind needs this time in order to recognize and react the right way. Refreshing slumber helps you hit the reset button on a bad day, improve your outlook on life, and be better prepared to meet challenges.

          <details>
            <summary>Healthier Heart</summary>
            While you sleep, your blood pressure goes down, giving your heart and blood vessels a bit of a rest. The less sleep you get, the longer your blood pressure stays up during a 24-hour cycle. High blood pressure can lead to heart disease, including stroke.
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Steadier Blood Sugarv</summary>
            During the deep, slow-wave part of your sleep cycle, the amount of glucose in your blood drops. Not enough time in this deepest stage means you don't get that break to allow a reset -- like leaving the volume turned up. 
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Germ Fighting </summary>
            Ongoing lack of sleep changes the way your immune cells work. They may not attack as quickly, and you could get sick more often. Good nightly rest can help you avoid that tired, worn-out feeling, as well as spending days in bed as your body tries to recover.
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary> Weight Control </summary>
            When you're well-rested, you're less hungry. Being sleep-deprived messes with the hormones in your brain -- leptin and ghrelin -- that control appetite.
