        <h1>Improving the Quality of Sleep</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Are you getting enough sleep? Are you getting quality sleep? </b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Most of us need around 8 hours of good-quality sleep a night to feel
          and perform at our best. Some will need more and some less. This
          can depend on factors such as age, health, and lifestyle.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are lots of factors that can cause poor sleep. Some of these
          include: stress and anxiety, drinking too much alcohol/caffeine, a
          poor sleeping environment, disturbance from children or partners,
          bad sleeping habits, or medical factors.

        </p>

        <p>
          The effects of a lack of sleep are well known and many of us will
          have experienced these at one time or another during our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these effects include feeling irritable and moody,
          difficulty concentrating and staying alert, and not being able to
          work properly. Aside from these, prolonged sleep deprivation can
          have consequences for your physical health as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          If any of this resonates with you, it's time to look at your sleep
          habits.

          <h2>Benefits of good sleep quality</h2>
          <p>
            Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout
            our lives. Even the way you feel while you're awake depends in
            part on what happens while you're sleeping. Getting enough quality
            sleep at the right times can help protect your mental health,
            physical health, quality of life, and safety.

              <summary>Sharper Brain</summary>
              Without enough sleep, it's tough to focus and take in new
              information. Your brain also doesn't have enough time to
              properly store memories so you can pull them up later. Sleep lets
              your brain catch up so you're ready for what's next.
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>Mood Boost</summary>
              Another thing that your brain does while you sleep is process
              your emotions. Your mind needs this time in order to recognize
              and react the right way. Refreshing slumber helps you hit the
              reset button on a bad day, improve your outlook on life, and be
              better prepared to meet challenges.
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Healthier Heart</summary>
              While you sleep, your blood pressure goes down, giving your
              heart and blood vessels a bit of a rest. The less sleep you get,
              the longer your blood pressure stays up during a 24-hour cycle.
              High blood pressure can lead to heart disease, including stroke.
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Steadier Blood Sugar</summary>
              During the deep, slow-wave part of your sleep cycle, the amount
              of glucose in your blood drops. Not enough time in this deepest
              stage means you don't get that break to allow a reset -- like
              leaving the volume turned up.
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Germ Fighting</summary>
              Ongoing lack of sleep changes the way your immune cells work.
              They may not attack as quickly, and you could get sick more
              often. Good nightly rest can help you avoid that tired, worn-out
              feeling, as well as spending days in bed as your body tries to
              recover.
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Weight Control</summary>
              When you're well-rested, you're less hungry. Being
              sleep-deprived messes with the hormones in your brain -- leptin
              and ghrelin -- that control appetite.

        <p>
          The effects of poor sleep can be serious and far-reaching. The
          long-term effects of sleep deprivation are proven. It drains your
          mental abilities and puts your physical health at real risk. Science
          has linked poor slumber with a number of health problems, from
          weight gain to a weakened immune system.

          <h4>Difficulty Concentrating and Staying Alert</h4>
          <p>
            When you are suffering from a lack of sleep you will find it hard
            to concentrate on things like work and even simple tasks. You may
            feel tired during the day or when performing activities such as
            driving which can put yourself and others at risk.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
          <!-- col-2-row-1-item-2 -->
          <h4>Memory Issues</h4>
          <p>
            During sleep, the brain forms connections and helps you process
            and remember new things. A lack of sleep can hinder ths process
            and impact both your long and short term memory.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
          <!-- col-3-row-1-item-3 -->
          <h4>More Accident Prone</h4>
          <p>
            Being drowsy can increase your risk of accidents either from being
            too tired to concentrate and respond to stimulus (e.g. driving a
            car). You may be prone to take more risks, as you aren't able to
            assess the situation properly. A lack of sleep can also affect your
            balance and coordination which again may make you more prone to
            accidents.

        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
          <!-- col-1-row-2-item-1 -->
          <h4>Feeling Irritable and Moody</h4>
          <p>
            A lack of sleep can make you moody, emotional and short
            tempered.

          <h4>Overeating</h4>
          <p>
            The chemicals which signal to your brain that you are full are
            affected by lack of sleep, which is just one of several ways that
            poor sleep may be tied to obesity and problems with maintaining a
            healthy weight.

          <h4>Immunodeficiency</h4>
          <p>
            Sleep deficiency has been shown to lead to worsened immune
            function, making you more susceptible to getting illnesses,
            including a poorer response to vaccines.

          <h4>Other Health Risks</h4>
          <p>
            <b>The cardiovascular system: </b> Lack of sleep may lead to
            increased blood pressure and higher levels of inflammation and
            increases your risk of cardiovascular disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Diabetes: </b> Lack of sleep efects the body's release of
            insulin. People who do not get enough sleep have higher blood sugar
            levels and an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Mental health disorders: </b>
            Sleep and mental health are closely intertwined, and poor sleep
            has strong associations with conditions like depression, anxiety,
            and bipolar disorder.

          <summary>How did we form a group?</summary>
          <p>
            Likii, our community leader, wanted to participate in Hacktoberfest challenge organised by Digital Ocean and
            GitHub last year but couldn't find any repositories that fitted her level of experience with back-end and
            didn't
            find many valuable front-end repositories either.
          </p>


          <p>
            Because of that, Likii has opened up our own repository and hosted a personalised-card challenge for other
            junior developers in the same situation. By the end of the event our repository collected just over 20
            personalised cards and we got to learn how to work as a team. Shoutout to people who helped us with git
            conflicts at the time 💛
          </p>

          <p>
            Since that was quite fun, Likii wanted to repeat the experience but unfortunately this was a once per year
            event. Instead of waiting that long, Likii created our junior developer group in order to work with a small
            team focusing on front end technologies. A lot has changed since October but we've learned a great deal of
            things and are ready to show.
          </p>
        </details>


        <details>
          <summary> What's our journey been like since then? </summary>
          <p>
            We started working as a team in January 2021. At the beginning of our journey we discussed how would we like
            things to happen and what the rules would be. Shortly after that we have created our set of rules, our
            members researched Agile methodologies and presented us with Scrum and Kanban workshops - after which we
            became a team learning to practice Scrum. A couple of weeks after that we replaced Trello (our main
            ticketing board) with an Open Source Jira Board!
          </p>


          <p>
            Today we work in sprints and run sprint reviews (friday focus sessions) as well as count just over thirty
            discord members. As we're growing fast, we needed to re-evaluate the services we're using to support us and
            have since decided to use WONDR platform to help keep up with everything.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the moment we're in the process of transfering things over, but feel free to click on a link in the
            footer and have a poke around 🙂

        <details>
          <summary>What communication tools do we use?</summary>
          <p>
            Our main communication is still happening on our discord channel, but within the next couple of weeks we'll
            be moving to WONDR, where our main communication tool will be WONDR messenger.
          </p>


          <p>
            Apart from chatting in text form, we like to meet up on Friday's for about an hour. We talk about our
            tickets, our blockers, our wins and we also throw in a couple of jokes 🙃
            Since many of us aren't native English speakers and aren't available for these meetings, we always post a
            meeting summary in text form. You can find those in our WONDR community.

          <summary> How do we solve conflicts?</summary>
          <p>
            We're all coming from various backgrounds and have important stories to tell. Sometimes those backgrounds
            and/or ideas might clash, sometimes we might say something we didn't mean in that particular way and
            sometimes it's all just a bit complicated.. In those times, it's important for a team to have built a good
            foundation for psychological safety and it's growth.
          </p>


          <p>
            To us, psychological safety means asking the difficult questions, challenging developers who might be more
            experienced than you are and feeling able to bring up any topic to the table. Psychological safety comes in
            many shapes and forms but in this team it's all about accepting each other, feeling safe, valued and heard.
          </p>

          <p>
            In not so recent times, we did have a situation that required active team members to gather around and make
            a decision. We discussed the issue, shared opinons and provided options. Our aim was to share the burden of
            'telling someone off' and the burden of decision making.
