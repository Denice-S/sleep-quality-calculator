            Most of us need around 8 hours of good-quality sleep a night to feel
            and perform at our best. Some will need more and some less and this
            can depend on factors such as age, health and lifestyle.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are lots of factors that can cause poor sleep, some of these
            include: stress and anxiety, drinking too much alcohol/caffeine, a
            poor sleeping environment, disturbance from children or partners,
            bad sleeping habits or it could also be due to medical factors.

              Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout
              our lives. Even the way you feel while you're awake depends in

                <summary>Sharper Brain</summary>
                Without enough sleep, it's tough to focus and take in new
                information. Your brain also doesn't have enough time to
                properly store memories so you can pull them up later.Sleep lets
                your brain catch up so you're ready for what's next.

                <summary>Mood Boost</summary>
                Another thing that your brain does while you sleep is process
                your emotions. Your mind needs this time in order to recognize
                and react the right way. Refreshing slumber helps you hit the
                reset button on a bad day, improve your outlook on life, and be
                better prepared to meet challenges.

                <summary>Healthier Heart</summary>
                While you sleep, your blood pressure goes down, giving your
                heart and blood vessels a bit of a rest. The less sleep you get,
                the longer your blood pressure stays up during a 24-hour cycle.
                High blood pressure can lead to heart disease, including stroke.

                <summary>Steadier Blood Sugar</summary>
                During the deep, slow-wave part of your sleep cycle, the amount
                of glucose in your blood drops. Not enough time in this deepest
                stage means you don't get that break to allow a reset -- like
                leaving the volume turned up.

                Ongoing lack of sleep changes the way your immune cells work.
                They may not attack as quickly, and you could get sick more
                often. Good nightly rest can help you avoid that tired, worn-out
                feeling, as well as spending days in bed as your body tries to
                recover.

                When you're well-rested, you're less hungry. Being
                sleep-deprived messes with the hormones in your brain -- leptin
                and ghrelin -- that control appetite.
